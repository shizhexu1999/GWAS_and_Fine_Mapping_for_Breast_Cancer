# **GWAS and Fine-Mapping for Breast Cancer**
**********************************************

## Summary
This repository contains code and scripts to uncover putative casual variants for breast cancer through GWAS and fine-mapping.

## Study Objectives
- We conducted a GWAS analysis to identify genetic susceptibilities for overall breast cancer and its subtype (ER positive, ER negative and triple negative) using the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) dataset. The GWAS summary statistics will be contributed to the **Confluence** project, which is collaboration among breast cancer consortia to conduct the largest and most diverse breast cancer GWAS to date.
- We applied and compared various fine-mapping methods to evaluate their performance, including conducting multi-ancestry analyses.  Evaluation metrics included credible set sizes and posterior inclusion probabilities (PIP).
- We conducted downstream analysis such as the polygenic risk score (PRS) and heritability estimation, and explored associations between PRS and other omic data, including proteomics.
- We investigated the integration of fine-mapping with machine learning frameworks to enhance the identification of causal variants.
